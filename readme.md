# Recompressed Builds of Subtitle Edit

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that fetches the latest upstream release of **Subtitle Edit**, unpacks it, and recompresses it into a 7z archive with maximum compression.

## Where to Get the Files

The recompressed builds are published under the [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/ddrezip/subtitleedit/releases) page of this repository.

> **Note:** If you are viewing this project on a mirror, such as Gitlab or Framagit, no release assets are attached there.  
> Please use the GitHub mirror to download the 7z files.

## Upstream

Original releases are published by the upstream project: [Subtitle Edit upstream releases](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit/releases)  

This repository does not modify the software itself, it only repackages existing upstream binaries.
